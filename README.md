# CMPUT291
File and Database Management

Glossary:

Assignments:  Two assignments to solve problems.  The first (Asst1) is to create a diagram to represent the connections between all SQL files
              The second (Asst2) is to write SQL queries

Projects: MP1 and MP2 are both integrations of databases into python programs.  MP1 has a readme to go with it and uses SQL
          MP2 uses another database to store data and most of the manipulation is done within the program itself.
